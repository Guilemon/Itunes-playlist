# Itunes-playlist

This App utilizes Reactjs library, bootstrap framework and iTunes API.
Webpack was used for bundling the app modules together.

* Note: Nodejs Server file is added just for deployment on heroku. The development was done using Webpack Dev Server.

To run using webpack dev server, replace start script in package.json with this:                                                                                
    ```"start": "node ./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js",```

## APP Structure and Description
* **Webpack config file:**
    This file contains configuration setting for webpack dev server, module loaders for es6 to es5 traspilation and plugins for production build.

* **index.html file:**
    This file contains static markup with stylesheet and js files imported along with one root container div declared for attaching the react components to.

* **bundle.js file**:
    output js file generated by webpack by compiling modular code.

* **package.json file**:
    contains all dependent node modules, scripts and app information.

* **Style Folder:**
    style.css - contains additional css rules for app designing.

* **Src Folder:** This folder contains the modular js files.

## The design of App is as follows:
* All component files are present in component folders.
```Index.js``` file imports root React Component defined in ```app.js``` file and using ```react-dom``` render method, attaches the app component to root html tag(defined in ```index.html```)

* In App.js file, the api data is fetched and passed to a component loop.

The component loop result is stored in a variable and that variable is called in app's render function.

* On clicking the grid component, a full page sidebar pop ups.

To handle its transitions, a state ```showMenu``` is used. This state is passed as prop to Sidebar component. In ```sidebar.js```, the passed prop is used to determine class to be applied on sidebar component. CSS transition property is used for sidebar transitions on click of grid element.

* The sidebar component contains additional information regarding the clicked album.

This is achived by assigning the data of clicked element to ```selectedAlbum``` state. On Click, the ```selectedAlbum``` state is updated with clicked elements data dynamically. The element and action for this is mentioned in ```albumListItem.js``` file. It also assigns ```showMenu``` state to true which triggers the sidebar to be activated.

The ```selectedAlbum``` state is passed as prop to ```popDetails.js``` file where the particular information is extracted and put in template file.

* A spinner is added for slow connections. Its occurence is handled by ```isLoading``` state.
